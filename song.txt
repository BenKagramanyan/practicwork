Freezin'
Rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again
Oh, feelin'
Maybe he'll see a little betters, any days
Oh, hand out
Faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar
Oh, dark grin
He can't help, when he's happy he looks insane
Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Oh, someday yet he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again
Kneelin'
Lookin' through the paper though he doesn't know to read
Oh, prayin'
Now to something that has never showed him anything
